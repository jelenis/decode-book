# Decode-Book ⚡

**AI-assisted electrical code search, reasoning, and citation engine**

Decode-Book is a portfolio project that explores how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can be applied to structured regulatory text (electrical code material) to produce accurate, scoped, and fully-qualified answers instead of hallucinated summaries. The project combines semantic search, keyword search, and deterministic rule-gating logic to answer electrical code questions with citations and conditions.

## 🚀 Core Features

- Hybrid search: semantic (embeddings) + full-text keyword search
- Deterministic ranking that favors coverage of distinct query terms
- Tool-driven RAG pipeline that enforces verification before answering
- Schema-only output for machine-parseable, auditable results
- Clear handling of default assumptions vs conditional (special-case) rules

## How it works (high level)

1. Content is parsed and chunked into passages suitable for embedding.
2. Each passage is converted to a dense vector (OpenAI embeddings in this project) and stored along with metadata in Supabase Postgres with `pgvector`.
3. User queries are embedded and nearest neighbors (top-K) are retrieved by similarity.
4. Retrieved passages are verified via keyword search and `getCode` where applicable.
5. A constrained prompt combines the retrieved evidence and returns a JSON schema-backed response.

This tool-first workflow prevents the model from answering without explicit evidence.

## RAG & Prompting (what's special here)

The project uses a detailed prompt (see `backend/supabase/functions/decode-book/prompt.txt`) that enforces:

- Use of `semanticSearch`, `keywordSearch`, and `getCode` tools in a specific order
- A final keyword verification step to catch missing companion requirements or exceptions
- Default assumptions (ordinary occupancy, typical wiring, utilization voltage ≤ 750 V) and explicit labeling of any special-condition rules as conditional notes
- Mandatory JSON-schema output for predictable downstream handling

These measures improve traceability and reduce hallucination by tying responses directly to retrieved code excerpts.

## Embeddings & Semantic Search

- Chunking: content is split to balance context and recall.
- Embedding: passages are embedded with an embeddings model and stored as vectors.
- Storage: Supabase Postgres + `pgvector` stores vectors and source metadata (rule numbers, section titles, raw text).
- Querying: queries are embedded and compared (cosine similarity) to stored vectors to retrieve the most relevant passages.
- Verification: retrieved passages are verified using keyword search and authoritative `getCode` lookups when rule numbers are present.

## Local development

Frontend (dev):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Deploy Supabase function (example):

```bash
cd backend
npx supabase functions deploy decode-book
```

Notes:
- Set environment variables for OpenAI and Supabase keys before running or deploying functions.
- The embedding pipeline and function code live under `backend/supabase/functions/decode-book/`.
